In the first task, users can input a range of numbers (an array). 
After that, the program squares each even number of the inputted array and returns it.
If there is an odd number, it is tripled and not squared.

# TASK 2
In the second task, the program takes the users input in string (words) form and also the first array of numbers we worked with.
Then a function is created to modiy each array. This function modifies each string based on its corresponding number in the first number array:
- Capitalize the entire string if the number is even.
- Convert the string to lowercase if the number is odd.

# TASK 3
In the third task, a new file is added called userInfo.js.
Then, a function called createUserProfiles takes an array of names and the array of modified names from Task 2.
 It then returns an array of objects, each containing originalName, modifiedName, and id (auto-incremented starting from 1).
